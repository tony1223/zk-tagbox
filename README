This is a project for porting tagedit to ZK Core.


It's inspired from jQuery tagedit plug-in.
( http://tagedit.webwork-albrecht.de/ )

It's a impressive jQuery plug-in.


For some reason I rewrote all the JS logic and only use the CSS I need ,
since we need not to have a form or input in ZK application.

And we could handle the auto-completed part better in ZK's model way. :)
